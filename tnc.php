                    <li>Upon cancellation of the Sale by the Company, the Company shall
                        refund the entire Sale Price to the Purchaser within 30 days of the
                        Sale. If the Purchaser paid the Sale Price through Payment on Billing,
                        the Company shall refund the Sale Price to the issuing bank used by the
                        Purchaser to make the payment of the Sale Price. If the Purchaser opted
                        to pay the Sale Price through Payment on Delivery, the company shall
                        cancel the invoice issued to the Purchaser. Provided however, that if
                        the Purchaser used a gift voucher to make the payment of the Sale Price
                        for the Sale, the Company shall issue a new gift voucher of equivalent
                        value or make credit available for such amount as deemed requisite by
                        the Company through the Purchase Account of the Purchaser, in accordance
                        with Clause 4.1(b) above.</li>
                </ul>
                <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Return and Refund of Sale Price</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Company will only accept return of a Product by the Purchaser if
                        the Product is delivered to the Purchaser damaged. Upon receipt of the
                        damaged Product, the Purchaser shall notify the Company in accordance
                        with Clause 5.2 below and provide such information as required by the
                        Company to ascertain the damage to the Product (in the Company's sole
                        discretion). The Company may extend or change the policy for individual
                        Products and this information shall be conveyed along with Product
                        information on the Website. If the Company declares a Product to be
                        damaged, then the Purchaser shall ship the Product back to the Company
                        in the manner set out in Clause 5.4 below.</li>
                    <li>The Purchaser may claim a refund of the Sale Price (as the
                        Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedy) within 12 hours of expiry of the
                        delivery time (including any extension thereof), as per the refund
                        policy stated on the Website. If the Purchaser does not claim a refund
                        within the time stated in the Refund Policy, the Purchaser shall not be
                        entitled to a refund of the Sale Price.</li>
                    <li>If the Purchaser fails to receive an item shipped on account of
                        providing inadequate or inaccurate delivery address or due to the
                        Purchaser's non-availability at the address provided or failure to make
                        requisite payment at the time of delivery in the case of Payment on
                        Delivery, the Sale will be cancelled and the Product will be returned to
                        the Company. Further, the Company will be entitled to recover
                        reasonable compensation for services provided and costs incurred for
                        shipping, handling, couriering, processing the Sale and/or the Product
                        and any other services provided to the Purchaser.</li>
                    <li>If the Product received by the Purchaser does not conform to the
                        Product description stated on the Website, the Purchaser may be entitled
                        to claim a refund for the Sale Price, in accordance with Clause 5.1. In
                        order to qualify for receiving refund, the Purchaser has to ship back
                        the Product, after first informing us at tokojamq@gmail.com, so
                        that a pick up can be rescheduled, along with a copy of the original
                        invoice issued by the Company, at the Purchaser's cost, within 24 hours
                        of receipt of delivery of the Product. Further, the Purchaser should
                        also contact the Company at tokojamq@gmail.com to furnish the
                        Company with such details, required by the Company, in order to
                        establish the Purchaser's reason for retuning the Product and claiming
                        refund. Upon the Purchaser doing so the Company has the option to
                        disagree to the same and put the refund claim on hold for checks and
                        verifications. The Company may contact the Purchaser for the purposes of
                        further verification. As a result of such verification, the refund
                        claim may either be accepted or rejected by the Company in its sole
                        discretion which shall not be disputed by the Purchaser. If the refund
                        claim is accepted then the Company shall have the option of offering
                        replacement of the Product at no additional cost to the Purchaser. If
                        the Purchaser declines such offered replacement, the Sale Price amount
                        shall be given to the Purchaser as a credit for future purchases, after
                        such deductions as required under applicable law.</li>
                    <li>All payments for refund of the Sale Price shall be as follows and in
                        accordance with the provisions contained herein and applicable laws in
                        India, particularly the directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India
                        from time to time for opening and operation of accounts and settlement
                        of payments for electronic payment transactions involving intermediaries
                        dated 24 November 2009.</li>
                    <li>For Payment on Billing, refund, if any, shall be made at the same issuing bank from where Sale
                        Price was
                        received.</li>
                    <li>For Payment on Delivery, refunds, if any, will be made via cheque or
                        demand draft in favour of the Purchaser (to such address as provided by
                        the Purchaser at the time of the Sale).</li>
                    <li>The Purchaser shall bear any foreign exchange conversion risk, loss, charges or fees, if any.
                    </li>
                    <li>Refund shall be subject to the Purchaser complying with the
                        provisions of the User Agreement and the rules and polices made
                        hereunder and the Company shall have recourse to such refund in case of
                        any misuse by the Purchaser.</li>
                    <li>If the Purchaser receives any credit, on any Product, in a
                        promotional scheme, or otherwise, this credit shall be only valid for
                        such period (not exceeding 1 (one) year) as set out by the Company in
                        relation to that promotional scheme or otherwise on the Website.</li>
