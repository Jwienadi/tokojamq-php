# TokojamQ E-commerce Website

An e-commerce website made by me and a teammate, based on a real wall-clock shop owned by a friend. This website was made as part of the Web Development and UX Design Coursework project in undergraduate program. Currently hosted on a free web hosting service, link: http://tokojamq.000webhostapp.com
